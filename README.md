#  Stock Price Analysis & Prediction

A **data analysis and machine learning project** that scrapes, cleans, and analyzes 4 years of daily stock price data, then builds a predictive model to forecast future prices.  
Includes **visualizations** for trend analysis and model interpretability.

---

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- **Web scraping** for historical financial data.
- **Data cleaning & preprocessing** for time-series datasets.
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Feature engineering** for improved predictive modeling.
- **Machine learning** to forecast future stock prices.
- **Visualization** of historical trends and predictions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation & cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ Predictive modeling & evaluation

---

##  Dataset

- **Source**: Scraped from an online stock data provider.
- **Frequency**: Daily closing prices, open, high, low, and volume.
- **Duration**: 4 years (â‰ˆ1,000 trading days).

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:
- Historical **trend analysis** of closing prices.
- Volatility patterns during specific time periods.
- Correlation analysis between features (e.g., open, close, volume).

---

##  Modeling

- **Approach**: Time-series regression using scikit-learn.
- **Pipeline**:
  1. Data preprocessing & scaling
  2. Train/test split
  3. Model training
  4. Performance evaluation
- **Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

---

##  Results

- Model captured **general trends** in stock price movement.
- Useful for **directional forecasting** and initial investment strategy simulation.
